  with a different token storage than the first one.

  OAuth2.onAuthenticate, TokenResource.onCustomGrantTypeRequest & ClientStorage.authenticateClient.
* ServerError now takes an optional message parameter.
* If the TokenFactory generates an invalid token,
  a ServerError is now returned instead of a ScopeError.

  instead of a ValueError if no singleton was registered.
* TokenStorage.hasAccess must now also accept a single scope.
